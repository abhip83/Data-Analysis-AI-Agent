# Data-Analysis-AI-Agent

# 🤖 Data Analysis AI Agent

A simple, powerful AI agent capable of analyzing tabular data and answering questions in natural language. 
This project demonstrates how to leverage
**LangChain**, **OpenAI GPT-4o**, and **Pandas** 
to create a conversational interface for your datasets.

## 📌 Overview

Data analysis often requires writing complex SQL or Python code.
This project bridges that gap by creating an agent that understands plain English queries and executes the necessary Pandas operations automatically.

The notebook includes:
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates a realistic "Car Sales" dataset for testing.
- **LangChain Agent**: Connects the LLM (Large Language Model) to the data using the `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` toolkit.
- **Interactive Querying**: A simple interface to ask questions like *"What is the average price?"* or *"How many rows are there?"*.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **LangChain** (Framework for LLM applications)
- **OpenAI GPT-4o** (Reasoning engine)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data manipulation)
